3. Upload your Excel file following the prompts.

## Step 2: Transform and Clean Your Data

2. Use the data cleaning tools provided:
    - Remove or correct invalid entries.
    - Standardize column names and formats.
    - Fill in or remove missing values as needed.
3. Ensure the final dataset contains the necessary columns for analysis (e.g., Employee ID, Department, Salary, Performance Score, Join/Exit Dates).

## Step 3: Analyze and Use the Dashboards

2. Explore visualizations for:
    - Workforce size and composition
